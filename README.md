This is my (currently) completely untested set of Lua utilities for building and training neural networks with. Imma use it to start the robot uprising.<br>
<br>
It gots a generate() function to make a blank network<br>
It also gots a think() function to run the network and get some outputs<br>
It as well gots a learn() function that optimizes the network based on its current and last errors<br>
It even gots a train() function to optimize the network to reflect a dataset of input-output maps<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
